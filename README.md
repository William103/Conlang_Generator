# Conlang_Generator
Generates complete languages from scratch.
INSTALLATION:
For latest version, just place the "Conlang_Generator" folder in your C.
For older versions, put all the .txt files in C:/Users/Public/Documents.

# NOTE
This was my first python project and I had no idea how to write good code.
Also, I had no idea how to write good readme's or make code easy for other
people to access, so this is a bit of a mess and is outdated enough for me
to not care about updating it.
